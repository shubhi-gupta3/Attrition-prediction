# Attrition-prediction<br>
### Employee attrition prediction using supervised machine learning.<br>
Attrition refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. Higher the attrition, the more problematic the situation is for the company. I have performed predictive analysis on this dataset which I have downloaded from Kaggle.<br>
Since this is a classification dataset, I have calculated accuracy of some machine learning algorithms like random forest classifier, gradient boost, etc.<br>
Heatmap is also created here for correlation reference. <br>
At last, for each algorithm confusion matrix is made for better analysis.
